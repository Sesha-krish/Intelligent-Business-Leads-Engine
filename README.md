## Purpose & Value Proposition

It is a reverse-engineered, redesigned, and AI-enhanced lead generation tool that simulates the core functionality of advanced scraping-based platforms used in talent acquisition and job hunting.

By combining **real-time web scraping, AI-powered scoring, and modern frontend design**, this tool provides **actionable insights** to both:

- **Recruiters** looking for top open-source developers with strong GitHub presence
- **Job Seekers** looking for high-growth companies actively hiring
